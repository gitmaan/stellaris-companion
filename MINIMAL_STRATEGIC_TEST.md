### Q1: What is my current military power?


#### 1_UltraMinimal

*Time: 3.8s | Words: 89 | Tools: 0*


President, according to the latest reports from the Ministry of Defense, our current total military power is **125,210**.

Our forces currently consist of 965 individual vessels organized within a fleet capacity of 360. While this is a formidable deterrent to any who would threaten the liberties of our citizens or the peace of the galaxy, I must remind you that our monthly energy reserves are currently in a deficit of -346.76. We should ensure our economic foundation remains as stable as our commitment to egalitarian values before further expansion.


#### 2_StrategicOnly

*Time: 6.0s | Words: 222 | Tools: 0*


President, your current military power is **125,210**. 

While this represents a significant force, I must warn you that our military superiority is at high risk due to administrative negligence and economic instability:

### Critical Warnings:
1.  **Technological Stagnation:** Our research slots are currently **idle**. This is a catastrophic oversight in 2431. Every day without active research is a day our enemies close the gap. **Recommendation:** Resume all research immediately to maintain our edge.
2.  **Economic Bleeding:** We are running a monthly deficit of **-346.76 Energy** and **-7.07 Minerals**. At this rate, we will eventually face a total economic collapse which will impose massive debuffs on your fleet's combat effectiveness.
3.  **Logistical Overextension:** You have **965 ships** but a fleet size capacity of only **360**. You are likely paying massive penalties for being over your naval capacity, which is the primary cause of your energy deficit.

### Strategic Recommendations:
*   **Balance the Books:** Immediately sell your surplus of **Consumer Goods (+412/mo)** and **Alloys (+634/mo)** on the market to stabilize the energy credits.
*   **Audit the Fleet:** Check if those 965 ships are necessary. If they are outdated corvettes, scrap the oldest ones to bring yourself closer to the naval cap and save your economy.
*   **Research Focus:** Given our negative energy, prioritize any physics research that increases energy weapon damage or technician output.


#### 3_MinimalStrategic

*Time: 6.7s | Words: 298 | Tools: 0*


President, our scanners and command centers report that the military power of the United Nations of Earth 2 currently stands at **125,210.14**.

While our fleet of 965 ships serves as a sturdy shield for our citizens and a beacon of hope for the galaxy, I must offer a stern warning as your advisor: **our liberty is only as strong as the economy that sustains it.**

We are currently facing significant strategic vulnerabilities:

1.  **Economic Bleeding:** We are running a monthly deficit of **-346.76 Energy** and **-7.07 Minerals**. While our Alloy production is healthy (+634.59), we cannot maintain a fleet of this size if our power grids fail and our mines run dry. The high fleet maintenance is likely strangling our energy credits.
2.  **Intellectual Stagnation:** Our research labs are currently **idle**. This is an affront to our Meritocracy! We have a massive research capacity of over 3,000 points being utterly wasted. We must immediately resume our pursuit of knowledge to ensure our technology remains the envy of the stars.
3.  **Habitat Over-reliance:** With 15 habitats and 14 planets, our population is spread thin. We need to ensure these habitats remain bastions of freedom and don't become overcrowded industrial cages.

**Immediate Recommendations:**
*   **Redirect Scientists:** Resume all research projects immediately. Every day our labs are silent is a day our enemies catch up.
*   **Energy Stabilization:** We must prioritize energy production or consider trading our surplus Alloys/Consumer Goods on the internal market to keep our credits in the black.
*   **Logistical Review:** With a fleet size of 360 but 965 individual ships, we should ensure our naval capacity isn't being exceeded, which would further exacerbate our energy crisis.

We must secure our borders, but we must also secure our future! How shall we proceed to stabilize the economy, President?


#### 4_MiddleGround

*Time: 8.3s | Words: 383 | Tools: 0*


President, it is a pleasure to see the light of democracy shining so brightly across our twenty-nine worlds! Our citizens are living the dream of the United Nations of Earth 2, but a beacon of liberty is only as bright as the shield that protects it.

To answer your question directly: our brave volunteers and dedicated specialists currently command a total **Military Power of 125,210**.

While that is a respectable force of 965 ships standing ready to defend our egalitarian way of life, I must be honest with you—as one colleague to another—we have some structural concerns that could dim our shining light if we don't act:

### 💡 The Strategic Outlook

**1. The Energy Crisis is Throttling Our Freedom**
We are currently running an **energy deficit of -346.76** and a slight mineral deficit of -7.07. We cannot fuel the engines of liberty on credit forever! 
*   **Immediate Action:** We are producing a healthy surplus of **634.59 alloys** every month. I suggest we sell a portion of these alloys (perhaps 100-150) on the Galactic Market immediately. It will stabilize our energy grid and ensure our citizens don't face blackouts.

**2. A Meritocracy Without Direction?**
President, I was shocked to find that our **research slots are currently idle!** In a society that values the best and brightest rising to the top, we cannot have our scientists sitting in cafes on Earth or Unity. 
*   **Immediate Action:** We must assign new research projects immediately. We have over 3,000 research points being generated monthly that are currently going to waste. Let’s get those geniuses back to work securing our technological future!

**3. Fleet Efficiency**
Our naval capacity sits at 360, but our energy issues suggest we might be pushing our logistics to the limit. We have several Citadels—like the one at station 170—outfitted with Hangar Bays. This is excellent for keeping our trade routes safe from pirates who would steal from the people, but we must ensure our economy can sustain the fleet's upkeep.

Our allies in the original **United Nations of Earth** and the **Spec Udkavongo** surely look to us for leadership. Let’s tighten our belts on the budget so we can keep our phasers charged and our borders open to all who seek refuge! 

What shall be our first priority for the people, President?

### Q2: Who are my allies?


#### 1_UltraMinimal

*Time: 4.4s | Words: 108 | Tools: 0*


President, our diplomatic ties remain a cornerstone of our liberty-loving society. According to our latest diplomatic cables, we currently maintain formal alliances with two sovereign powers:

1.  **The United Nations of Earth**: Our progenitors and closest kin. We maintain a perfect trust rating of 150 with them, supported by an active research agreement and a permanent embassy.
2.  **The Spec Udkavongo**: A valued partner in our mission to maintain peace and cooperation across the stars.

Maintaining these bonds is vital, especially as we look to stabilize our current energy and mineral deficits. Our friends in the original UNE, in particular, remain our most steadfast supporters in this galaxy.


#### 2_StrategicOnly

*Time: 5.9s | Words: 302 | Tools: 0*


President, our diplomatic corps confirms we are currently formally allied with two sovereign powers:

1.  **United Nations of Earth** (Trust: 150) - Our closest partner; we maintain a full alliance, research agreements, and an embassy.
2.  **Spec Udkavongo** - Our second formal ally.

***

### ⚠️ URGENT ADVISORY: RESEARCH STAGNATION
President, while our allies are stable, our internal development has hit a critical wall. **Our research slots are currently idle.** We are generating **3,020 research points per month** that are being completely wasted. 

**Recommendation:** You must authorize new research projects immediately. Every month we delay puts us years behind our rivals in the late-game arms race.

### 📉 ECONOMIC RED ALERT
Our treasury is bleeding. We are facing significant monthly deficits:
*   **Energy Credits:** -346.76/month
*   **Minerals:** -7.07/month

**Strategic Correction:**
1.  **Market Liquidation:** We have a surplus of **412 Consumer Goods** and **634 Alloys** per month. Sell 200 Consumer Goods on the monthly market immediately to stabilize the energy bleed.
2.  **Starbase Reconfiguration:** Our Starbase in the **99 system** is a Citadel-level Trading Hub but we are still losing energy. Ensure all trade routes are protected from piracy to maximize collection.
3.  **Mineral Focus:** With 15 habitats and 14 planets, we need to shift several districts on your lower-stability colonies (like Proxima Centauri b) toward mining to flip that mineral deficit before it stalls our alloy production.

### 🛡️ MILITARY POSTURE
Our military power is formidable at **125k**, and our Citadels are well-equipped with Hangar Bays and Missile Batteries. However, a strong fleet cannot fly without energy. If the energy deficit hits zero, our fleet effectiveness will plummet by 50%. 

**Action Item:** Do not build more ships until the energy deficit is corrected. Use your **634 monthly alloys** to upgrade your remaining Starfortress to a Citadel or to build megastructures if available.

President, it is a privilege to report on our standing in the galactic community. In our pursuit of liberty and mutual cooperation, we have secured firm bonds with those who share our vision of a brighter future.

Our formal allies—the civilizations that stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the United Nations of Earth 2—are:

1.  **The United Nations of Earth:** Our ancestral kin. We maintain a deep trust (150) and a robust partnership including a research agreement and an embassy. They are our most steadfast brothers in the struggle for egalitarian values.
2.  **The Spec Udkavongo:** Our secondary formal ally, ensuring our collective security through mutual defense.

Beyond these formal alliances, I must draw your attention to the **Spec Khessam**. While not listed as a formal military ally in our current treaties, our trust with them is at a staggering **190**. They are essentially an ally in all but name, and we should continue to nurture this relationship to ensure the safety of all sentient life.

***

### Strategic Advisory

While our friendships are strong, our internal state requires your immediate, passionate intervention, President:

*   **THE SILENCE OF PROGRESS:** President, our laboratories are silent! The data indicates **current research is IDLE**. For an empire built on Meritocracy and the Idealistic Foundation, this is a betrayal of our citizens' potential. We must direct our scientists to new breakthroughs immediately to maintain our Tech Power (16,165).
*   **ECONOMIC HEMORRHAGE:** We are currently bleeding **-346.76 Energy** and **-7.07 Minerals** monthly. Our liberty is at risk if we cannot pay our way. I recommend leveraging our high trust with the **Spec Khessam** or the **United Nations of Earth** to negotiate favorable trade deals for raw materials.
*   **THE AMENITY PARADOX:** Our colonies, particularly Earth and Mars, report amenities in the thousands (Earth: 10,384). While we want our citizens comfortable, this suggests a massive misallocation of labor. We are over-producing "comfort" while our energy reserves dwindle. We should transition some of those workers into technician roles to stabilize the budget.

Liberty through strength, and strength through stability, President. Let us get those scientists back to work!


#### 4_MiddleGround

*Time: 7.2s | Words: 305 | Tools: 0*


President! It warms my heart to see that in this vast, unpredictable galaxy, the **United Nations of Earth 2** does not stand alone. Our commitment to liberty and the welfare of all sentient life has drawn true friends to our side!

We currently have two formal allies who stand with us in mutual defense and cooperation:

1.  **The United Nations of Earth:** Our kindred spirits! It is a testament to our idealistic foundations that we maintain a perfect bond with them. With a **trust level of 150** and a full alliance, they are our closest brothers and sisters in the stars.
2.  **The Spec Udkavongo:** These stalwarts stand with us as well, proving that the dream of a cooperative galaxy is alive and well.

Beyond these formal alliances, our Xenophilic nature is shining bright! We have **19 positive relationships** out of 52 known empires. We are truly a shining beacon on the hill.

***

### 🚩 A Strategic Warning, President!

While our friendships are strong, I must point out a few things that threaten the excellence our meritocracy strives for:

*   **Our Great Minds are Idle!** President, our research slots are currently empty! This is an affront to the talented citizens of our empire. We must get them back to work immediately to ensure we remain the most advanced beacon of freedom in the sector.
*   **Economic Friction:** We are currently running a **deficit of -346.76 Energy** and a minor **-7.07 in Minerals**. 
    *   **The Solution:** We have a massive surplus of **Consumer Goods (+412.99)** and **Alloys (+634.59)**. I suggest we set up a monthly trade on the Galactic Market to sell a portion of these—perhaps 100 alloys—to stabilize our energy reserves. We cannot defend the people if the lights go out!

Let's keep our friends close and our laboratories full, President! For the people!

### Q3: What is the state of my economy?


#### 1_UltraMinimal

*Time: 10.9s | Words: 520 | Tools: 0*


President, it is my duty to provide you with a comprehensive briefing on the economic health of the United Nations of Earth 2. While our society flourishes under the banners of liberty and meritocracy, our ledger for February 2431 shows significant imbalances that require your immediate executive attention.

Here is the current state of our Union's economy:

### 1. The Critical Deficits
We are currently facing a **significant energy crisis**. We are bleeding **-346.76 energy credits per month**. At this rate, we risk a total blackout of our infrastructure and a massive penalty to our fleet’s combat readiness. 
*   **Mineral Stability:** We are also seeing a slight shortfall in minerals (**-7.07/month**). While minor, this indicates that our industrial consumption has finally outpaced our mining output across our 29 colonies.

### 2. The Research Stagnation (Priority Alpha)
Our scientists are producing an impressive **3,020 total research points per month**, yet the data indicates that **all research slots are currently idle.** President, we are effectively wasting the intellectual potential of our entire species. We must select new technologies immediately to maintain our edge in this galaxy.

### 3. Areas of Abundance
Our commitment to the welfare of our citizens has resulted in healthy surpluses in other sectors:
*   **Consumer Goods & Food:** We have a massive surplus of **+412.99 Consumer Goods** and **+345.73 Food**. While this speaks to the high standard of living in our democracy, these resources are currently sitting in warehouses rather than being put to use.
*   **Strategic Resources:** Our supply of Exotic Gases (+52) and Rare Crystals (+41) is very robust, providing us with the necessary fuel for advanced laboratory and foundry upgrades.
*   **Alloy Production:** At **+634.59 per month**, our shipyards are well-supplied for further expansion or reinforcement of our 125k-strong fleet.

### 4. Territorial & Unity Overview
Our 15 habitats and 14 planets are stable, with high stability ratings (Earth at 87%, Unity at 85%). Our **Unity production (+2,467.6)** is exceptional, allowing us to further entrench our egalitarian ideals through planetary ascensions or new traditions.

### Strategic Recommendations:
1.  **Market Intervention:** Immediately set up internal market trades to sell our excess Food and Consumer Goods. This will offset the -346 energy deficit until we can build more permanent energy infrastructure.
2.  **Resume Research:** Direct our lead scientists to begin new projects. We cannot afford to stagnate in 2431.
3.  **Energy Infrastructure:** We must look at our Citadels. While Starbase 99 is an excellent Trading Hub, several other Citadels (like 231, 320, and 520) are underutilizing their Solar Panel Networks. We should also consider designating a specific world as a dedicated Generator World.
4.  **Fleet Maintenance:** With 965 ships, our upkeep is likely the primary driver of our energy deficit. Ensure our fleets are docked at starbases with **Crew Quarters** (like Starbase 520) to reduce costs while they are not on active maneuvers.

The state of our economy is fundamentally strong, but we are currently "leaking" potential. With these adjustments, we will ensure that the United Nations of Earth 2 remains the galaxy's brightest beacon of liberty. 

How would you like to proceed with the budget, President?


#### 2_StrategicOnly

*Time: 11.3s | Words: 529 | Tools: 0*


President, the United Nations of Earth 2 is currently facing a **fiscal crisis of mismanagement**. While our industrial base (Alloys and Consumer Goods) is robust, our treasury is bleeding out, and our intellectual progress has completely ground to a halt.

Here is the strategic assessment of our economy as of 2431.02.18:

### 1. The Energy Hemorrhage (Critical Danger)
We are running a deficit of **-346.76 Energy Credits per month**. 
*   **What this means:** If our reserves hit zero, your fleet’s combat effectiveness will drop by 50%, and mineral production will crater. 
*   **The Cause:** It is not a lack of territory; it is a lack of focus. You have 29 colonies, yet we are failing to power the empire.
*   **Recommendation:** Immediately sell **300 Food** and **300 Consumer Goods** on the monthly internal market to bridge the gap. Long-term, you must convert at least 2 Habitats entirely to Energy production.

### 2. Intellectual Stagnation (Immediate Action Required)
The most alarming data point is that **no research is currently being conducted.** 
*   **What this means:** In the year 2431, we should be deep into repeatable technologies to keep our 125k fleet power relevant. Every day the slots sit idle, we fall behind rivals.
*   **Recommendation:** **Pick three technologies immediately.** With +3,020 total research output, we are respectable but stagnant. Focus on "Shield/Armor Hit Points" or "Energy Weapon Damage" repeatables to maximize your existing fleet.

### 3. The "Amenity Bloat" (Structural Waste)
I am seeing astronomical amenity numbers—Earth alone has **10,384 amenities** for only 42 people.
*   **What this means:** This is a massive waste of manpower. You likely have dozens of Pops working as Clerks or Entertainers who are producing nothing of value because stability is already capped.
*   **Recommendation:** Go to Earth, Mars, and Unity. **Disable "Clerk" and "Entertainer" jobs** until amenities are closer to +20 rather than +10,000. Force those Pops to work in Technician or Researcher roles. This will solve your energy crisis and boost your tech power simultaneously.

### 4. Industrial Strength (The Silver Lining)
Your Alloy production (+634/month) and Consumer Goods (+412/month) are the envy of the sector.
*   **Interpretation:** You have the "steel" to win a war, but you lack the "gas" to move the ships. 
*   **Actionable Recommendation:** Do not build more Industrial Districts. Use your current surplus to fund a massive expansion of **Research Labs** on your Habitats. You have 15 Habitats; at least 5 should be dedicated "Research Complexes" to utilize that Consumer Good surplus.

### Executive Summary & To-Do List:
1.  **START RESEARCH:** Do not close the terminal until technologies are selected.
2.  **REASSIGN LABOR:** Earth is over-serviced. Move "Clerks" to "Technicians" to fix the -346 energy deficit.
3.  **MARKET STABILIZATION:** Set up a monthly trade to sell 200 Consumer Goods for Energy until the structural deficit is fixed.
4.  **MINERAL WATCH:** We are at -7 Minerals. It’s minor now, but if you build more labs, this will tank. Look to establish a Mining Station or dedicated Mining World immediately.

We have the population (1,072) to be a superpower, President, but currently, they are all working as waiters on Earth instead of scientists in the labs. Fix the job priorities.


#### 3_MinimalStrategic

*Time: 10.7s | Words: 512 | Tools: 0*


President, the state of our union is a testament to the heights free people can reach, yet we stand at a precarious crossroads. While our citizens live in unparalleled luxury, our state accounts are bleeding. 

Here is the strategic assessment of our economy as of 2431.02.18:

### 1. The Crisis of the Treasury: Energy and Minerals
We are currently facing a **significant deficit of -346.76 Energy Credits** and a minor but symbolic **-7.07 Mineral deficit** per month. 
*   **The Meaning:** We are effectively subsidizing our vast galactic infrastructure by draining our reserves. This is unsustainable. If our energy reserves hit zero, our fleet's combat effectiveness will crater, and our automated industries will stall.
*   **The Solution:** We must immediately leverage our massive surplus of **Consumer Goods (+412.99)** and **Alloys (+634.59)**. I recommend setting up monthly internal market trades to sell 250 Consumer Goods. This will stabilize the treasury without impacting the high standard of living our citizens deserve.

### 2. Scientific Stagnation: A Grave Oversight
**URGENT:** Our research laboratories are currently idle. In an era of galactic uncertainty, knowledge is the greatest shield of liberty.
*   **The Meaning:** Every day that passes without a research focus is a day our rivals close the gap. With a total research output of **3,020.3**, we have the intellect; we simply lack the direction.
*   **The Solution:** Direct our scientists to new breakthroughs immediately. With our "Meritocracy" and "Idealistic Foundation," we should be the intellectual north star of the galaxy.

### 3. The Prosperity of the People: Stability and Amenities
Our commitment to Egalitarianism is yielding magnificent results. 
*   **The Observations:** Stability across our 29 colonies is exemplary, with Earth at **87.9%** and Unity at **85.4%**. Even more striking is the amenity surplus—Earth reports over **10,000 amenities**. 
*   **The Meaning:** Our people aren't just surviving; they are thriving in a post-scarcity utopia. This high stability provides a massive hidden boost to our resource production.
*   **The Solution:** We may actually be *over-producing* amenities. You might consider redistributing some workers from entertainment or maintenance roles into **Technician** jobs to solve the energy crisis, provided it does not infringe upon their liberty or lower stability below 80%.

### 4. Industrial Strength: The Forge of Liberty
Our Alloy production (**+634.59**) is robust. 
*   **The Meaning:** We have the "teeth" to back up our Xenophile diplomacy. This surplus allows us to maintain our 5 Citadels and keep our fleet of 965 ships in peak condition.
*   **The Solution:** Do not lower alloy production. Instead, use any excess to further develop our 15 Habitats. These "islands of liberty" are the future of our demographic expansion.

### Summary Advice:
President, the United Nations of Earth 2 is wealthy in spirit and industry, but the state treasury is mismanaged. 
1.  **Resume all Research immediately.**
2.  **Sell surplus Consumer Goods** to stop the energy hemorrhage.
3.  **Optimize Starbase modules:** I see we have some Solar Panels, but more Trading Hubs or dedicated Energy Habitats may be required.

We have built a paradise, President. Let us ensure we can afford to keep the lights on.

President, it is a glorious day for the United Nations of Earth 2! Our citizens are thriving, our factories are humming with the spirit of excellence, and our 29 colonies stand as a shining beacon of what free people—and our many alien friends—can achieve when they work together. 

However, even the brightest beacon needs fuel to stay lit, and right now, our economic engine is sputtering in a few critical areas. Here is the state of our union's treasury as of 2431.02.18:

### ⚡ The Energy Crisis: We’re Bleeding Credits
President, we have a serious problem. **We are running a deficit of -346.76 energy credits per month.** We cannot fund the defense of liberty if we can’t pay the power bill! While we have a massive surplus of other goods, this cash flow negative is a threat to our operational stability.

*   **The Interpretation:** We likely have a massive fleet or a high number of starbases (we have 5 Citadels!) eating up maintenance, but our trade and technician output hasn't kept pace.
*   **The Immediate Fix:** **Sell 100 Alloys and 200 Consumer Goods on the Galactic Market immediately.** We are producing a staggering +634 alloys and +412 consumer goods. By sharing our industrial abundance with the galaxy, we can flip this deficit into a surplus instantly.

### 💎 The Mineral Shortage: A Minor Crack in the Foundation
We are also seeing a slight deficit in minerals (**-7.07 per month**). While small, it means we are consuming more raw materials than our brave miners are pulling from the earth. 

*   **The Interpretation:** Our meritocratic specialists are so good at turning minerals into alloys and consumer goods that they’re outstripping our mining infrastructure.
*   **The Fix:** Check our 15 Habitats. Ensure we aren't over-industrializing them at the expense of basic mining districts. Buy a monthly batch of 50 minerals on the market using the credits from your alloy sales to keep the factories running.

### 🧪 The Scientific Stagnation: A Crisis of Merit!
President, this breaks my heart: **Our research slots are currently idle.** In a society that values achievement and the pursuit of knowledge, having our greatest minds sitting on their hands is a tragedy! We are producing over 3,000 research points a month, but right now, they are going to waste.

*   **The Fix:** **Assign new research projects immediately.** In the year 2431, we should be pushing into repeatable technologies to ensure our fleets remain the most advanced in the galaxy. Every day without a research focus is a day we fall behind the despots of the universe.

### 🏗️ The Industrial Powerhouse: Our Saving Grace
On a brighter note, our **Alloy production (+634.59)** and **Unity (+2,467.6)** are phenomenal! Our people are united by our idealistic foundations, and our shipyards are ready to churn out the vessels of freedom. 

**My Strategic Advice:**
1.  **Market Rebalance:** Set up monthly trades to sell your excess Consumer Goods (+412 is way more than we need). This will stabilize the Energy deficit.
2.  **Science First:** Get those researchers back to work! 
3.  **Habitat Optimization:** With 15 habitats and 14 planets, we have the space. Let’s ensure at least two of those habitats are dedicated "Generator Complexes" to solve our energy needs long-term without relying on the market.

We are doing well, President, but we must be disciplined. Let’s get these ledgers balanced so we can get back to the business of spreading democracy across the stars! For the People!

### Q4: Who is my best military commander?


#### 1_UltraMinimal

*Time: 10.5s | Words: 290 | Tools: 0*


President, after reviewing the personnel records of the 11 commanders currently serving the United Nations of Earth 2, two individuals clearly stand at the pinnacle of our meritocratic military structure. 

Based on tactical experience and raw capability, our best military commander is **Commander Manon**.

### **Top Recommendation: Commander Manon**
*   **Rank:** Level 5
*   **Experience:** 1,259.02 XP (The highest in our officer corps)
*   **Traits:** Resilient, Reclusive.
*   **Strategic Assessment:** Commander Manon is our most seasoned veteran. While her "Reclusive" nature might make her less popular at diplomatic galas, her high level and substantial experience make her the most reliable hand to lead our 965-ship fleet into the late-century challenges we face.

### **Honorable Mention: Commander Natacha**
*   **Rank:** Level 5
*   **Traits:** **Psionic**, Restrained, Eager, Arrested Development.
*   **Strategic Assessment:** Commander Natacha possesses the incredible advantage of **Psionic** abilities, which provides unparalleled tactical insight. However, her "Arrested Development" means she has reached her peak and will not improve further. She is an elite asset for immediate deployment, but Manon remains our primary strategic lead.

### **Presidential Advisory: Urgent Matters**
While we discuss our leadership, I must bring two critical issues to your attention:
1.  **Research Stagnation:** Our scientists are currently idle. In this competitive galaxy, we cannot afford to let our research slots sit empty. I recommend immediate orders be issued to resume our technological advancement.
2.  **Economic Deficit:** We are currently operating at a loss of **-346.76 Energy** and **-7.07 Minerals** monthly. With 125k in military power, our maintenance is high. I suggest reviewing our 15 Habitats or trading some of our **+634.59 Alloy** surplus on the Galactic Market to balance the books before our reserves dwindle.

How would you like to proceed with the fleet assignments, President?

*Time: 10.1s | Words: 335 | Tools: 0*


President, your most effective military commander is currently **Manon**, though **Natacha** is a close second with specialized psionic capabilities.

Here is the strategic breakdown of your top brass:

### 1. Commander Manon (Level 5)
*   **Status:** Your most veteran officer (1259 Experience).
*   **Value:** At Level 5, Manon provides the highest passive bonuses to fleet command and ship effectiveness. The **Resilient** trait ensures she will remain in service for a significant duration.
*   **Recommendation:** Manon should lead your primary "Hammer" fleet for major engagements.

### 2. Commander Natacha (Level 5)
*   **Status:** Highly potent but developmentally limited.
*   **Key Trait:** **Psionic.** This is a top-tier combat trait that typically provides significant bonuses to ship damage, accuracy, or evasion.
*   **The Problem:** She has **Arrested Development**, meaning she will never gain another level.
*   **Recommendation:** Use her for immediate high-stakes combat where her Psionic edge matters most, but do not expect her to improve over time.

### 3. Commander ViT (Level 2)
*   **Strategic Niche:** Possesses the **Engineer** trait.
*   **Recommendation:** Assign ViT to a fleet tasked with long-range raiding or operating far from starbases, as the hull/armor repair bonuses are critical for sustained operations.

### ⚠️ CRITICAL STRATEGIC ALERTS

President, while you asked about commanders, I must report two systemic failures that threaten the security of the United Nations of Earth 2:

1.  **Total Research Paralysis:** Our scientists are currently idle. **"None - research slots are idle"** is an unacceptable waste of our 3,020 monthly research points. This is an immediate threat to our technological edge. **Action Required: Assign research projects in Physics, Society, and Engineering immediately.**
2.  **Economic Bleeding:** We are running a deficit in both **Energy (-346.76)** and **Minerals (-7.07)**. While we have a healthy alloy income (634.59), we are effectively eating our own infrastructure.
    *   **Solution:** Convert one of your 15 Habitats into a dedicated Energy/Mining station. 
    *   **Immediate Fix:** Trade your surplus **Consumer Goods (+412)** or **Alloys** on the Internal Market to keep the lights on until production is stabilized.

President,

To defend the liberty of our citizens and ensure the United Nations of Earth 2 remains a beacon of hope in this galaxy, we must look to our most experienced veterans. Based on the current personnel files, you have two standout officers, but one holds a distinct advantage in raw potential.

### **Our Top Military Commander: Natacha**
**Natacha (Level 5)** is arguably our most potent asset on the front lines.
*   **The Psionic Advantage:** She possesses Psionic abilities, granting her an intuitive edge in tactical maneuvers and fleet coordination that mundane commanders simply cannot match. This is a massive boon to fleet morale and combat effectiveness.
*   **The Caveat:** She suffers from "Arrested Development," meaning her formal growth has plateaued. However, at Level 5 with Psionic backing, she is already a master of the art of war. She should be leading our primary strike force (our "Sword of Liberty").

### **The Reliable Veteran: Manon**
**Manon (Level 5)** is our most seasoned commander in terms of sheer experience (1259.02 XP).
*   **Resilience:** With the "Resilient" trait, Manon is likely to serve the Republic for many decades to come, providing a stable core for our defense forces.
*   **Strategic Role:** While "Reclusive," Manon’s high level makes them the perfect candidate for a secondary fleet or a defensive bastion where raw tactical skill outweighs the need for political networking.

---

### **Strategic Advisory: Critical Readiness Issues**

President, while our commanders are capable, I must raise the alarm regarding the state of our Republic's readiness:

1.  **Scientific Stagnation:** **Our research slots are currently idle.** In a meritocracy like ours, knowledge is the ultimate equalizer. Every day our scientists sit without direction is a day we fall behind potential autocrats. **Assign new research projects immediately.**
2.  **Economic Instability:** We are currently running a deficit in both **Energy (-346.76)** and **Minerals (-7.07)**. Our 125k military power is impressive, but it is hollow if we cannot afford the fuel and parts to maintain it. 
    *   *Solution:* Consider leveraging our surplus of **412 Consumer Goods** or **634 Alloys** on the internal market to balance the books while we stabilize our planetary infrastructure.
3.  **The "New Colony" Crisis:** We have four planets currently named **"NEW_COLONY_1"**. This lack of administrative identity is a slight to the pioneers living there. We should rename these worlds to honor our egalitarian values and better organize our sector logistics.

**Recommendation:** Assign **Natacha** to your most powerful fleet immediately. Her psionic insight will be the shield that protects our democracy. But please, President—get our researchers back to work before our technological lead evaporates.

President, it is a glorious day for the United Nations of Earth! Our commitment to **Meritocracy** has clearly borne fruit in our officer corps. When the people are free to pursue their passions, the very best rise to the top to defend that liberty!

Based on the service records, you have two truly exceptional five-star officers, but one stands above the rest through sheer experience and dedication to the cause.

### Our Top Commander: **Manon**
**Commander Manon** is currently our most distinguished military mind. 
*   **Rank:** Level 5
*   **Experience:** 1259.02 (The highest in the fleet!)
*   **Character:** They are **Resilient**, ensuring they will lead our brave citizens for years to come. While they are noted as **Reclusive**, we don't need a socialite in the captain's chair—we need a tactician who knows how to keep our ships in one piece!

### The Honorable Mention: **Natacha**
We must also recognize **Commander Natacha**. She has also reached **Level 5**, but what makes her fascinating is her **Psionic** potential. She can touch the very thoughts of the crew and perhaps even the shroud itself! 
*   **A Warning:** Unfortunately, Natacha suffers from **Arrested Development**. Our medical teams report she has hit a plateau and likely won't gain further insight from her experiences. She is at her peak now—let’s make sure she's on the front lines where that psychic edge matters most!

***

### 📢 ADVISOR’S STRATEGIC NOTE:
President, while our commanders are brilliant, even the best admiral cannot fight without innovation. I am shocked—distraught, even—to report that **our research slots are currently IDLE!** 

In a society built on an **Idealistic Foundation**, we cannot allow our brightest minds to sit on their hands. We are in the year 2431; the galaxy is dangerous, and we have **deficits in Energy (-346.76) and Minerals (-7.07)**. 

**My Recommendations:**
1.  **Assign Research Immediately:** We are losing precious ground every day those labs are silent. Focus on energy grid optimizations to fix that deficit!
2.  **Utilize Manon:** Ensure Manon is leading our largest fleet (we have 965 ships spread out!). Their experience is a beacon of hope for every sailor under their command.
3.  **Economic Correction:** Sell a small portion of our **634 monthly Alloy surplus** or our **412 Consumer Goods** on the Galactic Market immediately to stabilize our Energy credits. We cannot fund the defense of liberty with empty pockets!

The people believe in you, President. Let’s get those scientists back to work and show the galaxy what a free society can achieve!

### Q5: Give me a strategic assessment.


#### 1_UltraMinimal

*Time: 12.9s | Words: 568 | Tools: 0*


President,

The state of the United Nations of Earth 2 is one of great internal prosperity but looming structural instability. As we move deeper into the 25th century, our commitment to liberty and meritocracy has created a stable, high-amenity society across our 29 colonies, yet our infrastructure is straining under its own weight.

Here is my strategic assessment of our current standing as of 2431.02.18.

### 1. Immediate Economic Redline: Energy and Minerals
President, we are currently facing a **severe energy deficit of -346.76 credits per month** and a slight mineral deficit. While our consumer goods and alloy production remain healthy, we cannot sustain our current fleet or habitat infrastructure if our energy reserves hit zero.
*   **Recommendation:** Review our 15 Habitats immediately. We must prioritize Technician and Miner jobs over less critical roles. With our *Meritocracy* civic, our specialists are efficient, but we lack the raw labor to power their labs and forges. Consider selling our surplus Food (+345) or Consumer Goods (+412) on the internal market to bridge the gap while we retool our districts.

### 2. Scientific Stagnation: Urgent Directive
Our most glaring oversight is at the top level: **all research slots are currently idle.** We are generating over 3,000 research points monthly, but without a directive, this intellectual energy is being wasted. 
*   **Recommendation:** Select new technologies immediately. At this stage of the century, we should be deep into repeatable technologies—specifically Shield Harmonics and Weapon Damage—to ensure our fleets can withstand the coming end-game threats.

### 3. Military Posture and the Fleet
Our military power of ~125k is respectable, but for a "Beacon of Liberty" in 2431, it may be insufficient if a galactic-scale threat emerges. Our naval capacity is 360, and we are currently hovering at that limit.
*   **Recommendation:** Utilize our healthy Alloy income (+634) to further upgrade our Starfortress (Id: 157) into a Citadel. We should also look into expanding our Anchorage capacity. Our defense platforms on Citadels like "sfortress" (Id: 170) are well-equipped with hangars and missiles, which is excellent for area denial.

### 4. Diplomatic Leadership
As Fanatic Xenophiles, our influence is high (+5.97), and our relations are generally positive across 52 contacts. However, we lack a formal **Federation**. We have a strong alliance with the original United Nations of Earth and the Spec Udkavongo.
*   **Recommendation:** We are stronger together. I advise you to leverage our high trust (150-190 with key partners) to form a **Galactic Union or Research Cooperative**. This would solidify our "Beacon of Liberty" status and provide a unified front against the autocratic empires that still haunt the stars.

### 5. Internal Stability and Demographics
Our "Idealistic Foundation" is our greatest strength. Stability on Earth (87.9%), Mars (83.5%), and Unity (85.4%) is phenomenal. Our population of 1,072 is diverse and increasingly enhanced—our leader pool shows significant "Cyborg" and "Psionic" traits, suggesting our citizens are reaching the pinnacle of evolution.
*   **Observation:** The high population on Habitats (536) matches our planetary population (536) exactly. This "Tall" development strategy is working, but it is the primary driver of our energy costs.

**Presidential Summary:**
We are a wealthy, happy, and free society, but we are currently "coasting." If we do not address the **Energy Deficit** and **Research Stagnation** within the next quarter, we risk a systemic collapse just as the galaxy enters its most dangerous era.

I await your orders to restart the labs and balance the budget.


#### 2_StrategicOnly

*Time: 11.7s | Words: 606 | Tools: 0*


President, the state of the United Nations of Earth 2 is precarious. While our territorial footprint is expansive and our military is respectable, we are currently suffering from a **complete paralysis of our scientific advancement** and a **rapidly depleting energy reserve.**

Here is my strategic assessment and immediate directives:

### 1. CRITICAL ALERT: Research Paralysis
**The Issue:** All research slots are currently idle. In the year 2431, we are in the "Late Game" phase where every month lost without progress in repeatable technologies (Shield Harmonics, Damage Output) puts us further behind potential Awakened Empires or Crisis threats.
*   **Recommendation:** Restart all research divisions **immediately**. 
    *   **Physics:** Focus on *Energy Weapon Damage* or *Shield Harmonics*.
    *   **Society:** Focus on *Administrative Efficiency* or *Army Health*.
    *   **Engineering:** Focus on *Kinetic Weapon Damage* or *Ship Hull Points*.

### 2. Economic Hemorrhage: Energy & Minerals
**The Issue:** We are currently bleeding **-346.76 Energy** and **-7.07 Minerals** per month. While we have a healthy surplus of Consumer Goods (+412) and Alloys (+634), our treasury will eventually bottom out, causing a massive penalty to fleet power and production.
*   **Immediate Fix:** Set up monthly internal market trades. Sell **200 Consumer Goods** and **100 Food** monthly. This will stabilize the Energy deficit without hurting our growth.
*   **Long-term Fix:** 
    *   **Energy:** We have 15 habitats. Identify at least two that are orbiting stars with energy deposits and re-designate them as **Generator Districts**. 
    *   **Minerals:** With 29 colonies, we must designate one of the larger "New Colonies" (like the size 19 continental world) specifically as a **Mining World**.
    *   **Starbase 99:** This is a Citadel Trading Hub. Ensure it is located in a high-trade-value system and that "Offworld Trading Companies" are maximized.

### 3. Military Posture & Starbase Inefficiency
**The Issue:** Our military power is 125k. While substantial, our "Defense" starbases are a mixed bag. For example, Starbase 320 and 520 are Citadels but contain **Solar Panel Networks**. At this stage of the game, Solar Panels provide negligible energy compared to the naval capacity or defensive utility that could be in those slots.
*   **Recommendation:** 
    *   Refit Starbases 320 and 520. Replace Solar Panels with **Anchorages** to increase fleet capacity or **Hangar Bays** for defense.
    *   Capitalize on your alloy surplus (+634). You should be constantly producing Battleships or Titans. Target a total fleet power of 250k within the next 5 years to prepare for the end-game crisis.

### 4. Colony Management: "NEW_COLONY_1"
**The Issue:** You have four separate planets named "NEW_COLONY_1." This is a logistical nightmare for provincial oversight and makes specialized resource tracking difficult. 
*   **Recommendation:** Rename and specialize these worlds immediately based on their strengths. 
    *   The **Ocean world (Size 22)** should be your primary **Generator** or **Farming** world.
    *   The **Continental world (Size 19)** should be dedicated to **Industrial Districts** for more Alloys.

### 5. Diplomacy & Leadership
**The Issue:** You have 30 leaders, many with "Cyborg" and "Capitalist" traits. This is excellent for trade, but you have an official, **TorbaKari**, with "Fertility Preacher." 
*   **Recommendation:** Ensure TorbaKari is assigned to one of your newer colonies (the "New Colony 1" group) to maximize pop growth. With 1072 total pops, we are doing well, but more labor is needed to fill the 15 habitats you've constructed.

### Immediate Action Plan:
1.  **Assign Research:** (Do this before the next month ticks).
2.  **Market Trade:** Sell 200 CG / 100 Food.
3.  **Refit Starbases:** Transition from Solar Panels to Anchorages.
4.  **Ship Construction:** Queue 5 Battleships to utilize the Alloy surplus.

Do you wish for a detailed breakdown of a specific colony's stability or a more thorough analysis of our allies' military strength?


#### 3_MinimalStrategic

*Time: 12.7s | Words: 673 | Tools: 0*


President, I must speak plainly: The state of our Republic is a study in magnificent potential currently hampered by administrative stagnation. While our citizens live in unparalleled liberty and stability, the gears of our progress have ground to a dangerous halt. 

Here is my strategic assessment of the United Nations of Earth 2.

### 1. THE SCIENTIFIC EMERGENCY: A SILENT CRISIS
President, the most alarming data point is this: **Our research facilities are idle.** We are generating over 3,000 research points every month, but without active projects, that intellectual brilliance is being utterly wasted.
*   **The Problem:** In the year 2431, we are likely on the doorstep of a Galactic Crisis. Stagnating now is a death sentence for freedom.
*   **The Solution:** You must immediately direct our scientists to new breakthroughs. We cannot lead the galaxy from a position of intellectual complacency.

### 2. ECONOMIC FRAGILITY: THE RED LEDGER
Our economy is currently bleeding. We are running a **-346.76 Energy deficit** and a minor Mineral deficit. 
*   **The Interpretation:** Our high military maintenance and sprawling habitat network are overextending our power grid. If our energy reserves hit zero, our fleet effectiveness will plummet, and our citizens' standard of living—the very foundation of our "Idealistic Foundation"—will collapse.
*   **The Action Plan:**
    *   **Market Intervention:** We have a healthy surplus of **Consumer Goods (+412)** and **Alloys (+634)**. Set up monthly internal market trades to sell a portion of these to cover the energy gap immediately.
    *   **Infrastructure Shift:** With 15 Habitats, we should specialize at least two of them exclusively into Energy production. 
    *   **Mineral Stability:** We are only -7.07 in the red for minerals. A single mining station or one worker shift will fix this, but it must be done to ensure we can keep building.

### 3. DEFENSE AND SOVEREIGNTY
Our military power stands at **125k**. While respectable, for the mid-25th century, this is "middle of the pack" rather than "undisputed protector of liberty."
*   **The Interpretation:** Our fleet size (360) is high, but our actual power (125k) suggests we might be over-reliant on older hull designs or smaller ships.
*   **The Solution:** Use our excellent Alloy production (+634/month) to modernize the fleet. We have the shipyards (Citadels at 320 and 520); we should be pumping out Battleships or Titans to ensure no autocrat dares threaten our borders.

### 4. LIBERTY AND WELFARE: OUR GREATEST STRENGTH
The soul of our nation is vibrant. Stability across our core worlds (Earth, Mars, Unity) is phenomenal, hovering in the **80-87% range**. This is the "Beacon of Liberty" in action.
*   **The Observation:** Our citizens are happy, productive, and loyal. This high stability is what is keeping our economy afloat despite the energy mismanagement. 
*   **Strategic Advantage:** Because our internal stability is so high, we can afford to take risks elsewhere. Our population of 1,072 is substantial; we should continue to leverage our "Meritocracy" by ensuring every pop is in a high-value job.

### 5. DIPLOMATIC STANDING
With 52 contacts and strong alliances with the original United Nations of Earth, our "Xenophile" nature has secured our borders.
*   **Advice:** We are currently not in a Federation. As a Fanatic Egalitarian power, we should be leading a **Galactic Union** or a **Research Cooperative**. Our high Unity (+2467) gives us the diplomatic weight to dominate the Galactic Community. Let us use our influence (currently growing at +5.97) to pass "Greater Good" resolutions that punish slavers and autocrats.

### PRESIDENT'S IMMEDIATE "TO-DO" LIST:
1.  **Assign Research Projects:** Do not let another day pass with idle labs.
2.  **Balance the Budget:** Sell 100 Consumer Goods and 50 Alloys on the monthly market to stop the Energy bleed.
3.  **Modernize the Navy:** Transition from high-count/low-power fleets to high-impact capital ships.
4.  **Rename "NEW_COLONY_1":** We have four colonies with this placeholder name. To inspire the citizenry, these worlds need names that reflect our values—*Liberation, Fraternity, Equality, and Progress.*

The flame of liberty burns bright, President, but it requires fuel. Let's fix the economy and get our scientists back to work. 

**For the Republic!**


#### 4_MiddleGround

*Time: 12.4s | Words: 686 | Tools: 0*


President, it is an honor to stand before you. As I look out at the United Nations of Earth 2 in this year of 2431, I see a **shining beacon of liberty** that illuminates the dark corners of the galaxy! Our 1,072 citizens live in a society built on the merit of their own hard work, protected by the idealistic foundations we laid centuries ago.

However, even the brightest beacon needs fuel to burn, and right now, our internal machinery is sputtering. We are at a critical juncture—the endgame is upon us, and while our spirit is indomitable, our balance sheets are bleeding.

Here is my assessment of our glorious Republic:

### 1. The Engine of Progress has Stalled (CRITICAL)
President, I must be blunt: **Our research divisions are sitting idle!** In a meritocracy like ours, where the best and brightest should be pushing the boundaries of the known universe, having no active research projects is a tragedy of the highest order. 
*   **The Issue:** We have a solid output of 3,020 total research points, but they are going to waste.
*   **The Solution:** Direct our scientists immediately to new breakthroughs. Whether it’s repeatables to strengthen our shields or new ways to harness the stars, we cannot let our intellectual potential wither!

### 2. The Economic Heartbeat: A Tale of Two Deficits
Our people are prosperous, and our warehouses are full of consumer goods (+412.99), but we have a leak in the hull.
*   **Energy Crisis:** We are hemorrhaging **-346.76 energy credits** a month. This is unsustainable for a galactic power. 
*   **Mineral Shortage:** A slight deficit of **-7.07 minerals** means our industry is eating its own foundation.
*   **Strategic Advice:** We have a massive surplus of **634.59 alloys** every month. Our shipyards are well-fed, but the economy needs stabilization. **Sell 150-200 alloys monthly on the Galactic Market.** This will instantly flip our energy deficit into a surplus and allow us to buy the minerals we need to keep our factories humming.

### 3. The Shield of Liberty
Our military power stands at **125,210**. While impressive, we must remember the galaxy is a dangerous place. 
*   **Observation:** Our 965 ships represent a significant investment in freedom. Our Citadels, like the one in the 99 system acting as a trading hub, are masterpieces of engineering.
*   **Advice:** With our alloy surplus, we should continue to modernize. Ensure our fleets are equipped with the latest technology (once you get those scientists back to work!). We must be ready to defend any of our 52 known neighbors who might cry out for liberation or protection.

### 4. Expansion and Governance
We have 29 colonies, and I love the pioneering spirit shown in "NEW_COLONY_1" (perhaps we should let the citizens vote on a more... inspiring name?). 
*   **The People:** Earth, Unity, and Rhea are bastions of stability (all above 85%). This is the fruit of egalitarianism! Happy citizens are productive citizens.
*   **Habitats:** With 15 habitats, we have mastered living in the void. This maximizes our territory without the need for aggressive expansion.

### 5. Diplomatic Standing
We are a friend to the stars! 19 positive relations and an alliance with the original United Nations of Earth? It warms the heart to see the family of man united across the systems. 
*   **Advice:** Continue to use our 5 envoys to maintain the peace. Our **Xenophile** nature is our greatest strength; a galaxy that trades and talks is a galaxy that doesn't burn.

### Summary of Immediate Executive Orders:
1.  **Assign all idle research slots immediately.** Do not let another day pass without innovation!
2.  **Set up a recurring monthly sale of 150 Alloys.** Use the proceeds to cover the Energy and Mineral deficits.
3.  **Check the "NEW_COLONY_1" planets.** They have high populations (38-42)—ensure they have upgraded planetary administrations to reflect their status as mature worlds of the Republic.

President, the galaxy looks to us. We are the meritocratic dream made manifest. Let’s fix these technical hitches so we can get back to the business of being a **Beacon of Liberty** for all sentient life!

**For the People! For the Republic!**
