# Next release

The next release is in development on `main`. The published app remains at v1.0.0; no new version or release date is assigned.

## Included since v1.0.0

- Broader localization across onboarding, settings, campaign history, and desktop controls.
- More reliable campaign selection, save ingestion, and stored provider credentials.
- Simpler AI setup, stable Gemini model selection, and bounded recovery that preserves saved Chronicles when generation fails.
- Guided MCP Relay setup for supported AI apps, with campaign readiness and optional Chronicle writing controls.
- Simpler public Chronicle sharing; existing unlisted publications retain their visibility.
- Provisional Cygnus 4.5/4.5.1 mechanics guidance and selected-policy reporting. Coverage is partial, not full save-format certification.

## Before release

- [ ] Complete the remaining fixes and improvements planned for this release.
- [ ] Validate a real Cygnus 4.5/4.5.1 save through ingestion, briefing, Advisor, and Chronicle; check population/faction and federation data. The current local fixture is Corvus 4.2.4. See [coverage audit](../patches/audits/4.5.1.md).
- [ ] Confirm MCP Relay setup and a campaign query in each advertised client on its supported platform.
- [ ] Run the final CI suite and packaged-app smoke checks, including provider setup, Chronicle refresh/sharing, and update/restart behavior.
- [ ] Choose the version, prepare 3–5 user-facing release bullets, and publish only when the release is requested.

Keep this list current as more work merges. Do not describe Cygnus support as complete until the save validation above passes.
