**THE CHRONICLE OF THE UNITED NATIONS OF EARTH**
*As transcribed by the Royal Chronicler for the Archives of Liberty*

### CHAPTER I: THE CRADLE UNFURLED
**2223 — 2240**

In the dawn of the 23rd century, the children of Gaia looked upon the velvet void not with fear, but with the burning hunger of the free. For centuries, humanity had been bound to a single sphere, but the year 2228 marked a shattering of chains: the first colonial expedition departed, carrying the dreams of billions to a second home among the stars. It was an era of breathless discovery, where the collective will of the people transformed raw alloys into the vessels of liberation.

Yet, the galaxy was a harsh tutor. The democratic engine hummed with the labor of its citizens, even as the treasury flickered under the weight of expansion. In 2240, a beacon of brilliance emerged in the form of the scientist Zosira K'Tun, whose appointment signaled a new age of intellectual pursuit. The United Nations did not merely seek to occupy space; they sought to understand it, proving that a society built on an idealistic foundation could weather any storm.

### CHAPTER II: THE HAND EXTENDED
**2241 — 2268**

The stars themselves trembled as the United Nations of Earth realized they were not alone. Eschewing the isolation of old Earth, the people chose the path of the Xenophile, extending the hand of friendship to the unknown. 2244 stands as a testament to this spirit, a year of monumental unity where the first great alliances were forged with empires #16777220 and #16777221. The embassy halls of Earth became the beating heart of a burgeoning galactic community.

Through the 2250s and 2260s, the Union swelled to five, then six worlds. Even as the food supplies wavered and the energy grids groaned under the demand of a trillion lights, the democratic spirit never faltered. The people tightened their belts, moved by a shared vision of a galaxy where every voice mattered. By 2267, the economy surged, and the United Nations stood no longer as a fledgling state, but as a Beacon of Liberty that could not be extinguished.

### CHAPTER III: THE GREAT WEAVING
**2269 — 2330**

On the first day of 2269, the UNE began a project that would forever alter the fabric of the cosmos: the Relay Bypass. What began as a single ambitious gate became a silver web, a celestial nervous system designed to bind the colonies together in an instantaneous embrace. As the years marched on, the "Relay Era" saw the construction of dozens of these megastructures, ensuring that the distance between Sol and the tenth colony, founded in 2297, was but a heartbeat.

The year 2315 heralded the birth of the Federation, a grand tapestry of civilizations united under the banner of mutual defense and shared progress. The democratic ideals of Earth became the blueprint for a sector-wide peace. Mineral wealth poured from the crusts of a dozen worlds, and by 2329, the treasury overflowed with the bounty of a thousand mines. The United Nations had mastered the physical realm, turning the void into a well-ordered garden of the people.

### CHAPTER IV: THE ARSENAL OF LIBERTY
**2331 — 2368**

As the 24th century deepened, a shadow began to stretch across the galactic rim, and the people of Earth responded with a roar that shook the firmament. In 2339, the military might of the Union underwent a metamorphosis of fire; in a single year, the fleet’s power surged by over three hundred percent. The "Arsenal of Liberty" was no longer a dream—it was a steel reality of nearly a hundred thousand combat-ready hulls. 

By 2360, the fleet power had swelled to a staggering 181,000, and by 2364, it exceeded 200,000. New habitats were hoisted into the heavens, and the twelfth colony was inaugurated in 2363, even as the Relay Bypass network reached its zenith of connectivity. The United Nations of Earth had become a titan of the stars, a fortress of egalitarian hope. But as 2368 dawns, the chronicles record a chilling shift in the wind. The Prethoryn Scourge, a nightmare from beyond the void, has consumed fifty-three systems. The final test of the people is at hand.
