# Stellaris 4.0 "Phoenix" Game Mechanics

<!-- LLM-transformed from official patch notes. Strategic implications included. -->

<!-- Reference tables — these survive load_patch_notes() stripping since they don't start with # or <!-- -->

**Pop Scale Reference:**

| Milestone | Population |
|-----------|-----------|
| Empire Start | 2,000 pops |
| New Colony | 100-500 pops |
| Colony Established | 100 pops (threshold) |
| Underdeveloped World | <1,000 pops |
| Standard Capital (mid-game) | 8,000-12,000 pops |
| Empire Total (mid-game) | 80,000-120,000 pops |
| Empire Total (late-game) | 200,000+ pops |

These population numbers are normal and expected. Do not treat them as alarming.

**Workforce Conversion:**

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Workforce per Pop | 1 |
| Workforce per Job | ~100 (so ~100 pops = 1 job) |
| Job Efficiency | Buildings multiply workforce capacity (e.g. 15% on 1,000 jobs = 1,150 effective) |

**Strata Hierarchy:**

| Stratum | Role | Gestalt Equivalent |
|---------|------|--------------------|
| Elites (top) | Rulers/leaders | N/A |
| Specialist | Skilled jobs | Complex Drones |
| Worker | Basic jobs | Menial Drones |
| Civilian (base) | Labor pool, migration | Maintenance Drones |

Demotion downward is slow; promotion upward is instant. Small numbers of unemployed Elites/Specialists are normal.

**Trade System:**

| Mechanic | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Market Currency | Trade (not Energy) |
| Energy | Standard resource, bought/sold on market |
| Planetary Deficit Cost | ~1/8 of Galactic Market value as Trade upkeep |
| Trade Deficit Effect | Reduces Job Efficiency + increases Empire Size penalties (cascading) |
| Ship Upkeep (Docked) | 0% Trade |
| Ship Upkeep (Friendly) | Reduced Trade cost |
| Ship Upkeep (Neutral) | Standard Trade cost |
| Ship Upkeep (Hostile) | High Trade cost |
| Juggernaut | No logistics upkeep; -75% fleet upkeep in system |
| Gestalt Trade | Via Logistics Drones (not Traders/Clerks) |

**District Specializations:**

| District Type | Specialization Slots | Jobs per Slot |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------|
| City | 2 | 100 |
| Generator | 1 | 100 |
| Mining | 1 | 100 |
| Farming | 1 | 100 |

Each specialization opens +3 building slots. Same specialization can stack on City Districts. Locked behind technologies.

### Population & Growth
* **Pop Groups:** Populations are organized into groups based on Species, Strata, Ethics, and Faction; production calculated per group, not per pop. (This allows for high-performance management of massive populations.)
* **Simultaneous Growth:** All Pop Groups on a planet grow simultaneously every month according to Logistic Growth formulas. Species diversity increases total growth. (Planets with high species diversity experience significantly faster total population growth than mono-species worlds.)
* **Assembly & Migration:** Machine and Organic Assembly can occur simultaneously. Only Civilians and unemployed pops auto-migrate; there are no manual "push" or "pull" growth modifiers.
* **Growth Mechanics:** Underrepresented species do not receive growth bonuses. Fractional growth is not carried over; instead, it represents a percentage chance to gain 1 full pop each month.

### Colonies
* **Colony Ships:** Colony ships deposit 100 pops. Development period ~2 years 10 months with no production, no growth, and extreme vulnerability to bombardment. (Early colonies require military protection.)
* **Colony Establishment:** A colony is considered established once it reaches 100 pops through growth or migration. Small colonies have no minimum growth floor and are entirely dependent on migration from the empire capital to reach viability.
* **Designations:** Colony designations and sector automation can be pre-configured during the colonization phase and apply immediately upon completion.

### Planetary Development & Zones
* **District Development:** Districts provide Jobs and Housing based on their development level. For example, a Mining District provides 200 Housing and 200 Miner jobs per level.
* **Zones:** Zones manipulate the jobs provided by Districts through conversion. A Foundry Zone replaces 200 Civilian jobs and 200 Housing with 100 Metallurgist jobs per development level. (Specializing planets via Zones is the primary method for producing advanced resources.)
* **Planet-Unique Buildings:** Buildings modify the output of existing jobs rather than providing new ones. For example, Mote Harvesters add Volatile Mote production to all Technician jobs.

### Empire Focus & Technology
* **Empire Timeline:** The Situation Log tracks major milestones and houses the Empire Focus system.
* **Focus Categories:** Empires select one of three primary focuses: Conquest, Exploration, or Development. Five tasks active at a time, weighted toward the chosen focus. Core tasks give progress in all three.
* **Retroactive Completion:** Tasks already accomplished are completed retroactively. Milestones grant guaranteed technology options. (This allows players to force critical technologies to appear in the research pool, reducing dependence on RNG.)
* **Task Management:** Unwanted or uncompletable tasks can be discarded for a small Unity cost to generate a new objective.

### Planetary Ascension
* **Ascension Tiers:** Planets can be ascended through multiple tiers at a Unity cost. Each tier increases the Colony Designation's Job Efficiency bonus by +10%. (Ascending core worlds with high job counts is the highest-value use of Unity in the mid-to-late game.)

### MegaCorp
* **Branch Offices:** 1 per planet, cost Influence (doubled vs another MegaCorp), add 5 Empire Size each.
* **Criminal Syndicates:** Commercial Pacts available. Criminal offices generate 25 Crime and are 25% more profitable on high-crime planets.

### Trade & Logistics
* **Automatic Collection:** Trade Routes are removed; trade is collected automatically across the empire.
* **Planetary Deficits:** Planets incur logistical upkeep costs in Trade based on local resource deficits, representing the cost of shipping goods from other worlds. (Maintaining planetary self-sufficiency or high trade value is required to avoid economic collapse.)
* **Trade Policies:** Net Trade (after logistics costs) is converted into other resources based on the active Trade Policy.

### Species & Colonization
* **Species Integration:** Each species has one "Default Template." All other subspecies automatically integrate into this default template over time. (This automates the process of genetic standardization without requiring constant special projects.)
* **Xenocompatibility:** This trait pools all planetary species into a single group for logistic growth purposes rather than producing hybrid pops.

### Leaders & Traditions
* **Trait Progression:** Leaders gain trait selection moments only on even-numbered levels.
* **Role-Based Traits:** A leader's current position (e.g., Scientist on a ship vs. Governor) heavily weights which traits appear during level-up. (Assigning leaders to specific roles early is necessary to "aim" their development.)
* **Eternal Vigilance:** The Eternal Vigilance Ascension Perk is unlocked by completing the Unyielding Tradition tree.
* **Curator Insight:** The cost of Curator Insight scales with Empire Size.

### Combat & Exploration
* **Escort Ships:** Escort-class ships have a base evasion value of 50.
* **System Spawning:** Prescripted systems and anomalies have variable spawn rates, ensuring that not every unique system appears in every game. (This increases the value of exploration in the early game.)
