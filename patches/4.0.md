# Stellaris 4.0 "Phoenix" Game Mechanics

<!-- LLM-transformed from official patch notes. Strategic implications included. -->

### Population & Workforce
* **Pop Groups:** Populations are organized into groups based on Species, Strata, Ethics, and Faction for calculation purposes. (This allows for high-performance management of massive populations.)
* **Scaling:** Population numbers are scaled by a factor of 100, allowing for granular growth and manipulation.
* **Simultaneous Growth:** All Pop Groups on a planet grow simultaneously every month according to Logistic Growth formulas. (Planets with high species diversity experience significantly faster total population growth than mono-species worlds.)
* **Growth Mechanics:** Underrepresented species do not receive growth bonuses. Fractional growth is not carried over; instead, it represents a percentage chance to gain 1 full pop each month.
* **Migration:** All population movement is handled via the auto-migration system; there are no manual "push" or "pull" growth modifiers.
* **Early Colonization:** Small colonies have no minimum growth floor and are entirely dependent on migration from the empire capital to reach viability.
* **Civilian Stratum:** The Civilian stratum represents the non-military workforce. Civilians replace the Clerk role and serve as the primary labor pool for the empire.
* **Starting Population:** Empires begin with a base of 2000 pops, the majority of whom are Civilians.
* **Workforce System:** Populations produce "Workforce," which is the resource required to fill available Jobs provided by districts and zones.

### Planetary Development & Zones
* **District Development:** Districts provide Jobs and Housing based on their development level. For example, a Mining District provides 200 Housing and 200 Miner jobs per level.
* **Zones:** Zones manipulate the jobs provided by Districts through conversion. A Foundry Zone replaces 200 Civilian jobs and 200 Housing with 100 Metallurgist jobs per development level. (Specializing planets via Zones is the primary method for producing advanced resources.)
* **Planet-Unique Buildings:** Buildings modify the output of existing jobs rather than providing new ones. For example, Mote Harvesters add Volatile Mote production to all Technician jobs.
* **Automation:** Colony designations and sector automation can be pre-configured during the colonization phase and apply immediately upon completion.

### Empire Focus & Technology
* **Empire Timeline:** The Situation Log tracks major milestones and houses the Empire Focus system.
* **Focus Categories:** Empires select one of three primary focuses: Conquest, Exploration, or Development.
* **Focus Tasks:** Completing tasks weighted toward the chosen Focus provides progress toward "Guaranteed Technology" unlocks. (This allows players to force critical technologies to appear in the research pool, reducing dependence on RNG.)
* **Task Management:** Unwanted or uncompletable tasks can be discarded for a small Unity cost to generate a new objective.

### Trade & Logistics
* **Trade Resource:** Trade is a standard resource and serves as the primary currency for the Galactic Market.
* **Automatic Collection:** Trade Routes are removed; trade is collected automatically across the empire.
* **Ship Logistical Upkeep:** Ships incur upkeep costs paid in Trade based on their current location:
    * **Docked:** 0% (Free)
    * **Friendly Space:** Reduced cost
    * **Neutral Space:** Standard cost
    * **Hostile Space:** High cost
* **Juggernaut Logistics:** Juggernauts have no logistical upkeep and reduce the upkeep of all ships in the same system by 75%. (Juggernauts are vital for maintaining long-term sieges in enemy territory.)
* **Planetary Deficits:** Planets incur logistical upkeep costs in Trade based on local resource deficits, representing the cost of shipping goods from other worlds. (Maintaining planetary self-sufficiency or high trade value is required to avoid economic collapse.)
* **Trade Policies:** Net Trade (after logistics costs) is converted into other resources based on the active Trade Policy.

### Species & Colonization
* **Colonization Threshold:** A colony is considered established once it reaches 100 pops through growth or migration.
* **Species Integration:** Each species has one "Default Template." All other subspecies automatically integrate into this default template over time. (This automates the process of genetic standardization without requiring constant special projects.)
* **Xenocompatibility:** This trait pools all planetary species into a single group for logistic growth purposes rather than producing hybrid pops.

### Leaders & Traditions
* **Trait Progression:** Leaders gain trait selection moments only on even-numbered levels.
* **Role-Based Traits:** A leader’s current position (e.g., Scientist on a ship vs. Governor) heavily weights which traits appear during level-up. (Assigning leaders to specific roles early is necessary to "aim" their development.)
* **Eternal Vigilance:** The Eternal Vigilance Ascension Perk is unlocked by completing the Unyielding Tradition tree.
* **Curator Insight:** The cost of Curator Insight scales with Empire Size.

### Combat & Exploration
* **Escort Ships:** Escort-class ships have a base evasion value of 50.
* **System Spawning:** Prescripted systems and anomalies have variable spawn rates, ensuring that not every unique system appears in every game. (This increases the value of exploration in the early game.)
