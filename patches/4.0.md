# Stellaris 4.0 "Phoenix" Game Mechanics

<!-- Key mechanical changes from the 4.0 overhaul. -->

### **Population System**

* **Ecumenopolises:** No pop growth bonus; strength is production density and job capacity (optimal for industrial specialization, not population farming)
* **Gaia Worlds:** +15% pop growth, 100% habitability for all species (optimal for population farming and high-stability colonies)
* **Pop Growth:** Base growth scales with planet capacity; larger planets grow pops faster
* **Workforce System:** Pops are grouped by species/strata and produce Workforce assigned to jobs (reduces late-game calculation overhead)

### **Districts & Specializations**

* **District Specializations:** City Districts can choose two specializations; Generator, Mining, and Farming districts each choose one
* **Specialization Benefits:** Provide extra jobs per district of that type; unlock after key technologies; each specialization opens +3 building slots
* **Urban Districts:** Primary source of housing and administrative capacity

### **Trade System**

* **Trade Routes Removed:** Trade value automatically collected empire-wide without route management
* **Trade Resource:** Unified "Trade" resource converts to energy, consumer goods, or unity based on trade policy
* **Trade Collection:** Starbases collect trade from systems within their range automatically

### **Technology & Progression**

* **Empire Focus:** New system providing guaranteed tech pathways based on chosen focus
* **Tech Weighting:** Research options weighted toward player's selected specialization
* **Repeatable Tech:** Scaling costs adjusted for late-game balance

### **Megacorp & Branch Offices**

* **Branch Office Enhancement:** Increased strategic value and resource generation
* **Criminal Syndicates:** Reworked mechanics for underground economy gameplay
* **Corporate Authority:** Streamlined commercial pact and trade federation benefits

### **Origins Balance**

* **Life-Seeded:** Starting planet has improved rare resource features (stronger early economy)
* **Subterranean:** Cave-dweller trait has 10% pop growth penalty (reduced from 20%); all planets get +2 max districts
* **Overtuned Traits:** Reduce pop growth by 1.5-5% depending on potency (tradeoff for powerful stat bonuses)
* **Pre-Planned Growth:** Adds 15% upkeep to food/minerals/alloys instead of growth penalty

### **Quality of Life**

* **Precursor Selection:** Individual precursor civilizations can be toggled on/off in game setup (minimum 4 recommended)
* **Empire Timeline:** Tracks major events throughout your game history
* **Expanded Databank:** Enhanced encyclopedia and information access
