# Stellaris 4.2 "Corvus" Game Mechanics

<!-- LLM-transformed from official patch notes. Strategic implications included. -->

### Origins & Civics

*   **Augmentation Bazaars:** Cybernetic traits are available for selection during initial empire creation (allows for immediate specialization in cybernetic builds).
*   **Clone Army:** The Clone Soldier trait carries a 25% increase to food and mineral pop upkeep; this penalty is 30% for Ascended Clones and 10% for Fertile Clones. Clone Vats provide a maximum of 20 pop assembly and require food upkeep (necessitates a strong raw resource economy to support rapid assembly).
*   **Knights of the Toxic God:** Luminous Blades grants +1 Admiral Level. Sparing the Toxic Entity enables the terraforming of Toxic World candidates. Knight jobs and quest rewards provide moderated Unity and Research output (shifts focus toward long-term quest completion and naval leadership rather than raw early-game science).
*   **Life Seeded:** The starting Gaia World contains high-yield rare resource features (provides early-game access to strategic resources for advanced building upgrades).
*   **Overtuned:** Overtuned traits carry a population growth penalty between 1.5% and 5% depending on the potency of the trait. The Pre-Planned Growth trait adds a 15% upkeep cost in food, minerals, and alloys (trades economic efficiency and growth speed for high individual pop productivity).
*   **Subterranean:** The Cave-dweller trait carries a 10% penalty to population growth and assembly. All planets receive +2 maximum districts (ideal for maximizing the utility of small planets or "tall" empire builds).
*   **Synthetic Fertility:** The Identity Repository operates with high upkeep requirements and moderated resource output (requires careful energy management during the pre-synthetic transition phase).

### Planetary Systems

*   **Ecumenopolises:** These worlds provide no bonus to population growth; their utility is focused entirely on massive industrial production and high job density (optimal for late-game manufacturing hubs).
*   **Gaia Worlds:** These worlds provide a +15% bonus to population growth and 100% habitability for all species (optimal for population farming and high-stability resource colonies).

### Astral Actions & Combat

*   **Summon Dimensional Fleet:** This action summons a fleet of Astral Cruisers and Astral Escorts equal to twice the number of explored Astral Rifts (rewards heavy investment in rift exploration with significant temporary naval power).

### Population & Workforce
* **Pop Fixes:** Infertile pops have zero growth. Reassigners bonus growth targets Zombies. Assimilation incurs no extra upkeep. Pop group decline recalculation fixed.
* **Branch Offices:** Crime Syndicate output corrected. No self-owned offices. Seize Assets transfers properly.

### Combat
* **Titan Fleets:** Titan fleet behavior fixed.
* **Bulwark & Asteroidal:** Battlewright and Asteroidal Carapace bonuses corrected (were incorrectly doubled).
* **Artillery Computers:** Artillery computers prefer median range targets.
* **Prethoryn:** Prethoryn no longer stall; they prioritize full system conquest. Prethoryn planets are bombardable.

### Empires & Leaders
* **Genocidal Empires:** No auto-attack on enclaves.
* **Paragons:** No second Destiny trait at level 8.

### Infernals DLC
* **Volcanic Worlds:** New planet type with unique districts.
* **Entropy:** New resource for Hyperthermia crisis path.
* **Origins:** Cosmic Dawn and Red Giant origins added.
* **Traits:** Thermophile trait and Volcanic Habitability trait added.
