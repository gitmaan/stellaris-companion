# Stellaris 4.3 "Cetus" Game Mechanics

<!-- LLM-transformed from open beta patch notes (2025-12-11 through 2026-02-06). Strategic implications included. -->

### Fleet & Naval Capacity
* **Ship Naval Capacity:** All ships use approximately 5x more Naval Capacity. Corvettes: 5, Frigates: 8, Destroyers: 10, Cruisers: 20, Battleships: 40, Titans: 80, Juggernauts/Colossi: 100. Base empire Naval Capacity is 50. (Fleets contain far fewer ships; each ship choice matters significantly more.)
* **Anchorages:** Provide +5 Naval Capacity (+3 with Naval Logistics Office) but incur Trade upkeep equal to their Naval Capacity contribution. (Naval capacity has ongoing economic cost.)
* **Frigates:** Frigates move at Destroyer speed with additional Utility and Aux slots and Destroyer-sized reactors. (Significantly more capable and versatile.)

### Combat
* **Summon Dimensional Fleet:** This astral action summons Escorts equal to the number of explored Astral Rifts, and Cruisers equal to half that number rounded down. (With 10 rifts: 10 Escorts + 5 Cruisers. Rewards sustained rift exploration.)
* **Perdition Beams:** Titan Perdition Beams and Ancient Ruination Glare deal collateral damage to ships near the target. Ion Cannons deal less collateral at shorter range. (Titans threaten groups of ships, not just single targets.)
* **Armor & Shield Hardening:** Higher-tier armor and shields grant (tier - 1)% Armor or Shield Hardening. (Late-game defenses scale better against raw damage.)
* **Disruptors:** Start at 50% shield and armor bypass at tier 1, increasing to 80% at Psionic tier, plus +25% damage against shields. (Strong generalist weapons throughout the game.)
* **Siege Computers:** Torpedo Combat Computers are renamed Siege Computers and add +50% to +100% damage vs. Starbases plus increased Bombardment Damage. (Dedicated siege fleets are far more effective.)
* **Eternal Vigilance:** No longer creates free defense platforms. Instead grants +20% home territory ship fire rate. (Defensive perk favors mobile fleets over static defenses.)
* **Ground Combat:** Army counts are generally reduced. Many weapon and defensive technologies also improve army health or damage. Orbital bombardment damage is slightly increased.

### Economy & Jobs
* **No Unemployment:** All unemployed pops demote to Civilian (or Maintenance Drone) at end of month. Resettlement costs are uniform across strata. (No unemployment management needed; no demotion timers.)
* **Technology Costs:** Halved across the board, but research output from jobs is also reduced. Space-based research deposits are relatively more valuable. (Exploration and expansion for research deposits matters more.)
* **Stability:** Most stability bonuses reduced to one-half to one-third of previous values. Reaching 100% stability is significantly harder. (Even small stability effects like +1 or +2 are meaningful investments.)
* **Job Efficiency:** Most job efficiency modifiers are reduced. Colony Designations now universally grant Job Efficiency to relevant jobs. Planetary Ascension increases the Designation effect by +10% per tier. (Designation choice is a key strategic decision.)
* **Soldiers:** Now Specialist jobs (Complex Drone for gestalts) with 1 Alloy upkeep. Strong, Very Strong, and Battle Thrall traits affect Soldier efficiency. (Standing armies have real economic cost.)
* **Empire Size:** Base Empire Size from pops is halved; from colonies is increased to 20. Most Empire Size reduction modifiers are reduced. (Wide play is slightly more penalized per colony but less per pop.)
* **Automation:** Automation buildings are job-specific with scaling Energy upkeep: 4 per 100 Worker jobs, 8 per 100 Specialist jobs, 12 per 100 Elite jobs. Only Fallen Empire buildings automate Specialist jobs. (Automation is a significant energy investment; Fallen Empire buildings are uniquely powerful.)
* **Unity & Factions:** Many Unity sources reduced; base production increased to 10. Factions have 50% reduced output during the first 10 years. (Unity income grows more slowly in the early game.)
* **Trade:** Branch Offices and private colony ships cost Trade instead of Energy. Subsidy Edicts grant +10-20% Job Efficiency with Trade upkeep. (Trade is more central to the economy.)
* **Ecumenopolis:** The Arcology Project and Ecumenopolis districts cost Alloys instead of Minerals. (Requires alloy stockpiling for transition.)
* **Living Standards:** Happiness penalties on lower living standards now apply to Civilians. (Living standard choice has broader impact on empire happiness.)

### Ethics
* **Authoritarian:** Worker Production bonus is now Worker Job Efficiency. **Egalitarian:** Specialist Production bonus is now Specialist Job Efficiency. **Pacifist:** Empire Size from Pops reduced to -10% (Pacifist) / -20% (Fanatic Pacifist).

### Species Traits
* **Broad Rebalance:** Many traits reduced from 30-50% bonuses to 15-25%. Examples: Erudite 20% researcher efficiency, Fertile 20% pop growth, Dark Matter Engines 20% job efficiency. Rare resource upkeep costs on advanced traits are generally increased. (No single trait dominates; trait selection is more about synergy than raw power.)
* **Cybernetic Traits:** No longer have flat energy upkeep. The Cybernetic trait swaps half of base food upkeep for energy.

### Origins & Civics
* **Necrophage:** Chambers of Elevation block necrophage species growth. Necrophyte Apprentices boost non-necrophage growth on the same planet. Mass conversion occurs via once-per-decade rituals. (Grow secondary species, then batch-convert.)
* **Driven Assimilators:** Start with 2,000 cyborg pops and 1,000 fewer machine pops. Augmentation Centers provide 400 jobs with Amenities and Organic Pop Growth for cyborgs. (More cyborg-focused from game start.)
* **Cybernetic Ascension:** Metabolic Reprocessing enables cross-assembly: robot assembly from Augmentors, organic assembly from Roboticists. New cyborg traits for pop growth and bureaucrat output. (Flexible workforce strategy across organic and synthetic pops.)
* **Cybernetic Creed:** Augmentation sub-civics provide +10% Job Efficiency to specific job types plus Bureaucrats. Creed traits are no longer locked to Spiritualist ethics. (More flexible empire design options.)
* **Eater of Worlds:** Doom power summons a fleet instead of starting a war. Fleet scales with Doom Intensity: escorts at 3-6, plus cruisers at 6-12, plus battleships at 12+. Intensity caps at 50. Summoning a new fleet dismisses the current one. (Fleet-summoning covenant, not war-trigger.)
* **Refugee Attraction:** Civics like Free Haven increase refugee flow; allowing slavery reduces it. Refugees prefer empires ruled by their own species. (Xenophile/egalitarian empires gain more population through migration.)

### Crises & Late Game
* **Crisis Fleets:** Prethoryn, Contingency, Extradimensionals, Great Khan, and other crisis fleets reduced by approximately one-third. Awakened Fallen Empire and Cetana fleets reduced by roughly half. (End-game crises are less overwhelming.)
* **Cosmogenesis:** Fallen Empires directly oppose experiments from stage 5, culminating in Total War. (Military preparation against Fallen Empires is required for Cosmogenesis.)
