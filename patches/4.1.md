# Stellaris 4.1 "Lyra" Game Mechanics

<!-- LLM-transformed from official patch notes. Strategic implications included. -->

### Origins & Civics
* **Slaver Guilds & Indentured Assets:** These civics provide Job Efficiency for Slaves; they do not enslave a fixed percentage of the population (allows for more precise control over which species are exploited without forcing enslavement on the primary species).
* **Resource Consolidation:** This origin allows empires to ignore the technology requirements for the Machine Worlds Ascension Perk (enables faster transition to specialized machine environments despite a lower initial power ceiling).
* **Planetscapers:** This civic spawns two different blockers on the homeworld. When combined with the Arc Welders origin, these blockers only occupy a single district each (minimizes the early-game economic footprint of planetary obstacles).

### Leaders & Governance
* **Governor Experience:** Leaders governing planets or sectors gain 10 XP whenever planetary infrastructure—including districts, buildings, or district specializations—is constructed. If both a local and sector governor are present, the local planetary governor receives the XP (incentivizes active construction to rapidly level up planetary administrators).
* **Planetary Ascension:** The maximum cost reduction for ascending planets is capped at 90% (prevents infinite scaling and ensures a minimum resource floor for high-tier empire development).
* **Computation Core Focus Policies:** These policies modify the job efficiency of specific jobs rather than the flat planetary production of resources (rewards empires that maximize specific job counts over general resource modifiers).

### Jobs & Buildings
* **Necromancers:** These jobs produce Society and Engineering research (shifts the focus of undead labor toward biological and structural advancement).
* **Dread Encampment:** This building provides additional research production and increased upkeep to Necromancer jobs (increases the output density of necromantic centers at a higher energy/resource cost).
* **Telepaths:** These jobs are excluded from planetary automation (requires manual oversight to manage psionic stability and ethics divergence).
* **Fallen Shipyard:** This planetary feature provides 1 miner job for every 25 pops on the planet (scales mining capacity with population density).
* **Ship Junkyard:** This planetary modifier provides 0.5 alloys and 0.5 engineering research per 100 miners (provides late-game scaling for dedicated mining worlds).
* **Rural Support Specializations:** Trade upkeep for farmers, miners, and technicians scales at a higher rate on Ringworlds (balances the extreme job density provided by Ringworld segments).

### Technology
* **Cultural Heritage:** This technology requires Planetary Unification as a prerequisite and is available for research by Hive Minds (standardizes the progression of unity-producing infrastructure).
* **Heritage Site:** This is a Tier 2 technology (delays access to mid-tier unity buildings until the mid-game).
* **Hypercomms Forum:** This technology has a high research cost (increases the investment required for advanced planetary communication and unity hubs).
