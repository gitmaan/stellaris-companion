### **Planetary Features & Modifiers**
*   **Fallen Shipyard:** This planetary feature provides 1 miner job per 25 pops. *(Strategic: Scaling is slow, making it most effective on high-population urban centers.)*
*   **Ship Junkyard:** This planetary modifier provides 0.5 alloys and 0.5 engineering research per 100 miners. *(Strategic: Requires massive industrial-scale mining operations to yield meaningful research and alloy output.)*
*   **Planetscaper Blockers:** Planetscapers start with two different blockers on their homeworld. When combined with the Arc Welders origin, these blockers only obstruct a single district. *(Strategic: Increases early-game clearing costs but minimizes the impact on district capacity.)*
*   **Ringworld Specializations:** Rural support district specializations on Ringworlds apply higher trade upkeep to farmers, miners, and technicians than on standard planets. *(Strategic: Ringworld resource production requires a more robust trade economy to sustain.)*

### **Civics & Origins**
*   **Slaver Guilds & Indentured Assets:** These civics provide Job Efficiency for Slaves. They do not automatically enslave a fixed percentage of the population. *(Strategic: Shifts the focus from forced demographics to maximizing the output of existing slave populations.)*
*   **Resource Consolidation:** This origin allows an empire to ignore the technology requirements for the Machine Worlds Ascension Perk, though it begins with lower initial power. *(Strategic: Trades early-game momentum for a direct, accelerated path to specialized Machine Worlds.)*

### **Leaders & Governance**
*   **Governor Experience:** Governors earn 10 XP whenever a district, building, or district specialization is constructed. If a planet has both a local and a sector governor, the local planetary governor receives the XP. *(Strategic: Rapidly developing colonies serve as ideal training grounds for high-level leaders.)*
*   **Telepath Management:** Telepath jobs are excluded from planetary automation. *(Strategic: Requires manual oversight to ensure psionic stability and ethics attraction are maintained.)*

### **Jobs & Production**
*   **Necromancers:** These jobs produce Society and Engineering research. *(Strategic: Shifts the focus of death-cult research away from Physics.)*
*   **Dread Encampment:** This building provides additional research production and increased upkeep for Necromancer jobs. *(Strategic: Concentrates research power into
