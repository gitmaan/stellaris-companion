Our commitment to liberty and the pursuit of knowledge has built a massive economic engine, but right now, that engine is burning more fuel than we\u2019re pumping in. \n\nHere is the state of the Union\u2019s treasury as of February 2431:\n\n### **The Bottom Line**\nWe have an **Economy Power of 17,124**, but we are currently operating in the red in two critical areas:\n*   **Energy Credits:** **-346.76** per month. This is our most pressing issue. Our expenses are roughly 4,448 credits against an income of 4,101. \n*   **Minerals:** **-7.07** per month. While this is a minor leak, it's a deficit nonetheless.\n\n### **The \"Red Alert\" Sector: Stockpiles**\nThe most alarming data point isn't the deficit itself, but our reserves. Our current stockpiles are dangerously low:\n*   **Energy Reserve:** **17** credits.\n*   **Mineral Reserve:** **20** units.\nPresident, we are effectively living paycheck to paycheck. Without immediate intervention, we face a total grid shutdown and industrial paralysis within the next month.\n\n### **The Strengths: Engines of Liberty**\nIt's not all grim! Our secondary industries and research labs are the envy of the galaxy:\n*   **Alloys:** **+634.59** per month. We are producing a healthy surplus for fleet expansion or mega-engineering projects.\n*   **Consumer Goods:** **+412.99** per month. Our citizens are well-supplied and the \"Idealistic Foundation\" of our society remains rock solid.\n*   **Research:** A combined **3,020.3** points per month. We are leading the way in Physics, Society, and Engineering.\n*   **Unity:** **+2,467.6** per month. Our people are more united than ever in their love for the Republic.\n\n### **Strategic Recommendations**\n1.  **Immediate Market Sell-Off:** We have a strong surplus of **Alloys** and **Consumer Goods**. I recommend selling a small portion of these on the Galactic Market immediately to bridge the Energy gap and replenish our reserves.\n2.  **Trade Negotiations:** We are in contact with **52 other empires** and maintain positive relations with 19 of them. Let\u2019s leverage our Xenophile charms. A few favorable trade deals\u2014perhaps trading some of our excess Alloys for a steady supply of Energy\u2014could stabilize us.\n3.  **Solar Expansion:** I see several of our Starbases (like Starbase 99 and 157) are focused on Trading Hubs or Anchorages. If we have room, adding **Solar Panel Networks** or optimizing our **Trading Hubs** with Offworld Trading Companies could help turn that Energy deficit around.\n\nWe have the talent and the technology, President. We just need to balance the checkbook so we can keep the lights on for liberty! What would you like to prioritize?",

Unity generation is also excellent at 2467.6 per month - a testament to our commitment to a harmonious society! We're also doing well with exotic gases (+52.76) and rare crystals (+41.87). Influence is also positive at 5.97. Food production is in a surplus with 345.73.\n\nHowever, we have two critical deficits that need immediate attention:\n\n*   **Energy:** We're down -346.76 energy credits per month. That's a significant drain!\n*   **Minerals:** We're also losing -7.07 minerals per month. While not as severe as the energy deficit, it's still a concern.\n\nLet's address these deficits swiftly, President. I suggest we prioritize energy production improvements. Minerals are less urgent but still require attention. I recommend we investigate our energy production sectors and mineral extraction efficiency to identify bottlenecks and potential upgrades.\n",

As we stand in 2431, our commitment to peace and liberty is well-supported by a respectable, if compact, defensive force. \n\nHere is the current status of our fleets:\n\n### **Naval Strength & Composition**\n*   **Total Military Power:** We currently project **125,210.14** in total combat strength.\n*   **Fleet Size:** Our active combat vessels are utilizing **360 units** of our naval capacity. While we have a reported **965 transponders** active across our territory, the bulk of this represents our extensive network of transport craft, science vessels, and patrol units that keep our borders open and safe.\n*   **Technological Tier:** Our ships are highly advanced. Our engineers have deployed **Tier 5 Mass Drivers** and we have begun mastering **repeatable energy weapon calibrations**. We are currently fielding hulls up to at least the **Cruiser class**, with significant structural reinforcements.\n\n### **Command Leadership**\nOur meritocratic values have truly paid off in our officer corps. We have **11 Commanders** currently commissioned:\n*   **Commander Natacha (Level 5):** Our most distinguished officer. As a **Psionic** leader, her mental acuity gives her an unparalleled edge in tactical maneuvers. She is a shining example of the heights our citizens can reach!\n*   **Commander SuV (Level 2):** A promising officer showing great resilience in the field.\n\n### **Naval Infrastructure**\nWe have secured our space with **6 major starbases**, including **5 massive Citadels**. \n*   **The Hub of the Navy:** Starbase **520** is our primary military installation, equipped with a **Fleet Academy** and **Crew Quarters**. This ensures our recruits are the best-trained in the galaxy before they ever see a front line.\n*   **Logistics:** Starbase **157** serves as our primary anchorage, supporting our fleet's sustainment needs.\n\n### **Strategic Advisory**\nPresident, I must be frank: our fleet's readiness is currently hampered by our economic situation. We are running a **monthly deficit of 346.76 Energy Credits and 7.07 Minerals**. \n\nWhile our 125k fleet power is formidable, it is relatively modest for the endgame era. If we intend to protect our xenophilic ideals against more aggressive neighbors\u2014or any potential galactic threats\u2014we must stabilize our energy grid to allow for further naval expansion.

We are running a **monthly energy deficit of -346.76** and a slight **mineral deficit of -7.07**. \n\nIf we're going to keep these Level 5 legends in the field with their 965 ships, we might want to look at our starbase trade hubs (like the Citadel in system 99) or perhaps check if **Official Dieter** (our \"Capitalist\" leader) can help balance the books. \n\nFor the glory of the United Nations of Earth 2, which fleet shall we assign Natacha to first?",

Here is the breakdown of our strategic assets:\n\n### **The Economic & Logistic Backbone**\n*   **ID 99 (Citadel - Trading Hub):** Our commercial crown jewel. It\u2019s packed with **6 Trading Hubs**, an Offworld Trading Company, and a Resource Silo.

It\u2019s uniquely fitted with a **Black Hole Observatory**, a Disruption Field Generator, and a Communications Jammer.\n*   **ID 231:** Another defensive powerhouse using Hangar Bays and Missile Batteries, but also contributes to our power grid with a Solar Panel Network.\n*   **ID 320:** A versatile station featuring a **Shipyard**, Hangar Bays, and Solar Panels. It\u2019s a great forward staging point for quick repairs.\n*   **ID 520:** Our primary military hub! This Citadel hosts a **Shipyard, Fleet Academy, and Crew Quarters**, making it the ideal place to commission new vessels and keep them in peak condition.\n\n**Strategic Note:** President, we are currently running an **energy deficit of -346.76** and a tiny mineral deficit of -7.07. While our alloys (+634.59) and research (+3,020.3) are looking fantastic, we might want to consider adding more Solar Panel Networks to our starbases where possible, or checking if we can maximize our trade routes through ID 99 to balance the books.

      "response": "Greetings, President! It\u2019s an honor to present this strategic briefing. As the beacon of liberty in a galaxy of fifty-two different voices, the United Nations of Earth 2 stands at a fascinating crossroads. The year is 2431, and while our ideals of meritocracy and freedom are shining bright, our accountants are currently having a collective nervous breakdown.\n\nHere is the state of our union:\n\n### 1. The Economy: A Leaky Hull\nPresident, we have a bit of a \"resource redistribution\" problem.\n*   **Energy Deficit (-346.76):** Our credits are draining faster than water on a desert world. We are likely over-relying on our 15 habitats without enough generator districts, or perhaps our fleet maintenance is eating us alive.\n*   **Mineral Shortfall (-7.07):** It\u2019s minor, but a deficit is a deficit. We cannot fuel our industrial heart on hope alone.\n*   **The Silver Lining:** We are producing a surplus of **634 Alloys** and **412 Consumer Goods** monthly.\n*   **Immediate Directive:** Use our healthy **+2467.6 Unity** to pass any edicts that boost resource output. Sell those excess Consumer Goods on the Galactic Market to stay solvent while we retool our habitats for energy production.\n\n### 2. Military & The Looming Shadow\nOur total military power sits at **125,210**. In a vacuum, that\u2019s a formidable force of 965 ships. However, given that it\u2019s 2431, we are officially in the \"Crisis Window.\"\n*   **The Risk:** To be blunt, 125k power might not be enough to protect our 29 colonies if an extradimensional threat or an ancient machine intelligence decides to gate-crash our democracy. \n*   **Recommendation:** We have the alloys (+634/mo). We need to maximize our naval capacity immediately. Use our Citadels\u2014especially the ones like **Starbase 520** which already has a Fleet Academy\u2014to churn out high-tier hulls. \n\n### 3. Diplomatic Landscape\nWe are the social butterflies of the cosmos! With **52 contacts** and **19 positive relations**, our Xenophile nature is our greatest shield. \n*   We have two firm allies (including Country 1), and remarkably, **zero rivals**. This is a testament to our diplomatic corps.\n*   **Strategy:** Since we aren't at war, we should focus on signing more Research Agreements. Our current research output of **3,020** is respectable, but in the endgame, \"respectable\" gets you conquered. We need to push into those repeatable technologies (like the energy weapon damage we are currently sampling) to stay competitive.\n\n### 4. Expansion and Development\nOur 29 colonies (14 planets, 15 habitats) are the heart of our Egalitarian dream. \n*   **Stability is Excellent:** Earth (87.9%) and Unity (85.4%) are models of democratic efficiency. \n*   **Naming Note:** We have several colonies still named \"NEW_COLONY_1\" (IDs 333, 472, 1459, 1571). Perhaps a naming contest to celebrate our \"Idealistic Foundation\" is in order? It would do wonders for morale!\n\n**Final Verdict:** We are a stable, happy, and prosperous society that is currently living slightly beyond its means. If we can balance the energy budget and double our fleet power in the next decade, the United Nations of Earth 2 will not just survive the endgame\u2014we will lead it.\n\nWhat would you like to focus on first, President? Balancing the credits or bolstering the fleet?",

      "response": "Alright, President! Let's dive into the state of our glorious United Nations of Earth 2. It's the year 2431, and while we're not currently embroiled in any wars \u2013 always a good thing for a beacon of liberty like us \u2013 we've got some economic wobbles that need our immediate attention.\n\n**Economic Overview:**\n\nOur economy is pulling in a respectable 17124.4 space-bucks, but those deficits are flashing brighter than a supernova. We're bleeding **346.76 energy credits** and **7.07 minerals** every month. That's not ideal, especially with our commitment to egalitarianism. We need to ensure everyone has the resources they need to flourish! On the bright side, we're swimming in alloys (+634.59 per month) and consumer goods (+412.99 per month), and our research is humming along nicely (totaling 3020.3).\n\n**Colonies and Population:**\n\nWe have a total of 29 colonies, split between 14 planets and 15 habitats, housing a total population of 1072. Our colonies appear to be in good health, with solid stability and overflowing with amenities.\n\n**Diplomacy:**\n\nWe're maintaining relations with a healthy 52 empires, with 19 of those being positive. Our allies, the original United Nations of Earth and the Spec Udkavongo, are invaluable partners. It's crucial to nurture these relationships and continue fostering goodwill throughout the galaxy!\n\n**Military:**\n\nOur military strength is sitting at a respectable 125210.14, spread across 965 fleets. Six starbases bolster our defenses, with a mix of citadels and starfortresses. We should ensure this is enough to protect our egalitarian ideals.\n\n**Leadership:**\n\nWe have 37 leaders, including scientists, envoys, officials, and commanders. It is of note that our research slots are idle, despite having 10 scientists. We need to get them working on society, physics, or engineering research.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Address the Energy and Mineral Deficit:** This is priority number one. We need to identify the cause of these deficits. Are we overspending, underproducing, or is there a distribution issue? I recommend checking our energy and mineral production across all colonies and starbases and reallocating pops to generator and mining districts. Perhaps some clever trade deals could also help alleviate the pressure while we reorganize internally.\n2.  **Idle Research Slots:** We need to get our scientists working. Check technology options to see if there is something beneficial to our situation, and assign our scientists accordingly.\n3.  **Fortify Key Systems:** While we aren't at war, a strong defense is the best deterrent. Ensure our starbases are well-equipped and strategically positioned to protect our core worlds and trade routes.\n4.  **Continue Diplomatic Efforts:** Our allies are vital. Keep strengthening those bonds and look for opportunities to expand our network of friendly nations. A galaxy united by common values is a galaxy at peace.\n\nPresident, these are my initial recommendations. Let's work together to ensure the United Nations of Earth 2 remains a shining example of egalitarianism and prosperity in the cosmos!\n",

    "question": "What should my top priorities be right now?",
    "current": {
      "response": "Greetings, President! It is a pleasure to provide you with this strategic assessment. Our beacon of liberty shines bright across the stars, but even the most idealistic foundation requires a stable power grid and a sharp sword to defend our freedoms.\n\nAs we move deeper into the 25th century (current date 2431.02.18), the galaxy looks toward the United Nations of Earth 2 for leadership. Here are my top priorities for our great democracy:\n\n### 1. Resolve the Energy and Mineral Deficit\nOur economy is currently straining under the weight of our vast infrastructure. We are seeing a **monthly energy deficit of -346.76** and a minor **mineral loss of -7.07**. \n*   **Action:** With 15 habitats and 14 planets housing 1,072 citizens, we need to re-prioritize some of our districts. I recommend converting some of our habitat space\u2014specifically those in systems with high trade value\u2014into dedicated trade zones or generator districts.\n*   **Strategic Note:** We have several Citadels, but only one (ID: 99) is fully outfitted as a Trading Hub. Building additional Trading Hubs could leverage our Xenophile trade bonuses to flip that deficit into a surplus.\n\n### 2. Form a Galactic Federation\nDespite having 52 known contacts and 19 positive diplomatic relations, we are currently **without a Federation**. This is a missed opportunity for a Fanatic Egalitarian society!\n*   **Action:** Reach out to our closest allies (ID 1 and 16777227) to form a Research Cooperative or a Galactic Union. This will bolster our collective security and provide significant bonuses to our **16,165 Tech Power**.\n\n### 3. Crisis Readiness & Fleet Modernization\nWhile our military power stands at **125,210**, we are in the endgame phase. History teaches us that the greatest threats to liberty often arrive unannounced in the mid-2400s.\n*   **Action:** Our current fleet size is 360, but with a monthly alloy surplus of **+634.59**, we have the industrial capacity to expand. Use our Citadels\u2014specifically those with Fleet Academies like Starbase 520\u2014to churn out more hulls. \n*   **Tech Focus:** I see we are already researching repeatable energy weapon damage. Let\u2019s double down on this to ensure our ships punch through whatever darkness the void throws at us.\n\n### 4. Administrative \"Identity\" Project\nPresident, on a more personal note for our citizens: several of our worlds (including those with populations as high as 42) are still officially registered as **\"NEW_COLONY_1\"**. \n*   **Suggestion:** As a Meritocracy that values every individual, perhaps we should give these 29 colonies proper names? It would do wonders for public morale on worlds like ID 1459 and 1571!\n\nThe galaxy is currently at peace (0 active wars), which is the perfect time to fix these structural issues. Let\u2019s secure our energy independence and strengthen our alliances so that the flame of liberty never goes out. \n\nWhat would you like to focus on first?",

      "response": "I seem to already have the colony information. My apologies. Let's dive deeper into our planetary situation, shall we?\n\nLooking at our top colonies, a few things stand out:\n\n*   **Earth:** Our capital is doing quite well, with high stability and amenities. Splendid!\n*   **Mars:** Also quite stable, though with fewer amenities than Earth.\n*   **Proxima Centauri b:** Stability is a bit lower here, at 62.34%. We should keep an eye on this colony and ensure its citizens' needs are met.\n*   The rest of the colonies all appear to be quite stable.\n\nGiven the energy and mineral deficits, I recommend the following:\n\n1.  **Prioritize Energy Production:** Focus on upgrading starbases that boost energy production, particularly those with solar panel networks.\n2.  **Develop Mineral-Rich Worlds:** Identify planets with significant mineral deposits and prioritize their development. Perhaps we can relocate some of our population to these worlds to maximize mineral extraction.\n\nLet me know if you'd like a more detailed analysis of any specific colony or aspect of our economy! I am always happy to assist in guiding our nation toward a brighter, more prosperous future!\n",

    "question": "What threats should I be worried about?",
    "current": {
      "response": "President, it is an honor to serve the United Nations of Earth 2. While our commitment to liberty and the idealistic foundations of our society remain our greatest strengths, the state of the galaxy in **2431** requires us to be pragmatically vigilant. \n\nHere is my assessment of the primary threats to our Republic:\n\n### 1. The Looming Shadow (Endgame Crisis)\nWe are deep into the endgame phase. Historically, this is when the galaxy faces existential threats\u2014be it the Prethoryn Scourge, the Unbidden, or the Contingency. \n*   **The Problem:** Our current military power stands at **125,210**. While significant, historical records of endgame crises suggest that invading forces often arrive with fleets totaling in the millions.\n*   **Recommendation:** We are currently below the weight class needed to solo a galactic crisis. We must leverage our **Xenophile** nature to ensure our 19 positive diplomatic relations (including our two allies) are solidified into a cohesive defense force.\n\n### 2. Economic Hemorrhaging\nOur treasury is reporting a monthly deficit of **-346.76 Energy Credits** and a minor loss of **-7.07 Minerals**. \n*   **The Risk:** If our energy reserves hit zero, our ships will suffer massive penalties to shield strength and weapon damage. In a sudden war, this would be catastrophic.\n*   **The Efficiency Gap:** I noticed something peculiar on planets like **Rhea** and **Earth**, which are reporting astronomical amenity levels (over **13,400** on Rhea alone!). While we love a good party, President, our citizens are *too* comfortable. We likely have far too many workers assigned to entertainment or services. Reassigning some of those citizens to **Technician** jobs would instantly flip our energy deficit into a surplus without hurting our **85-87% stability**.\n\n### 3. Diplomatic Friction in a Crowded Galaxy\nWith **52 known empires**, the galaxy is incredibly congested. \n*   **The Stats:** We have **9 empires** with negative relations toward us. While we have no active rivals or wars, the sheer number of neutral and hostile actors increases the chance of a \"spark\" igniting a localized conflict.\n*   **Territorial Integrity:** Our **15 habitats** and **14 planets** are spread across **188 celestial bodies**. This is a lot of surface area to defend with only **6 starbases** (5 Citadels and 1 Starfortress). If a hostile neighbor decides our \"Beacon of Liberty\" is a threat to their authoritarian ways, we may find ourselves fighting on too many fronts.\n\n### 4. Technological Stagnation\nWe have researched **Mega-Engineering** and are deep into repeatables like **Improved Tile Energy Output**. However, our fleet size of **360** suggests we aren't utilizing our full naval capacity. We have the brains, but we aren't putting enough \"steel in the water.\"\n\n**President\u2019s Checklist:**\n1.  **Optimize the Workforce:** Turn those entertainers into technicians to fix the **-346.76 energy** drain.\n2.  **Militarize Liberty:** Use our **634.59 monthly alloy surplus** to double or triple our fleet power before the Crisis arrives.\n3.  **Name the Pioneers:** Several of our top colonies are still named \"**NEW_COLONY_1**.\" Giving these worlds a proper identity would surely boost morale (though, perhaps not as much as those 13,000 amenities!).\n\nHow would you like to proceed? Our scientists are ready to focus on whatever you deem the highest priority.",

      "response": "Well now, President, while the galaxy may seem relatively calm with no active conflicts, a true leader keeps their eyes open!\n\nFirst, those energy and mineral deficits are simply unacceptable! Negative 346.76 energy and negative 7.07 minerals each month? We can't build a brighter future while running on fumes and scraping the bottom of the barrel. We need to address these shortages immediately.\n\nSecond, while we have many friends (19 positive relations), there are also some empires who don't share our vision of galactic harmony (9 negative relations). I recommend we call the `get_details` tool on \"diplomacy\" to investigate who these empires are and what their military strength is. Knowledge is power, and we need to know who might pose a threat to our egalitarian ideals!\n\nFinally, with a military power of 125210.14, we are certainly no pushover, but complacency is the enemy of freedom. Let's make sure we are keeping pace with the rest of the galaxy in terms of fleet strength and technology.\n",
